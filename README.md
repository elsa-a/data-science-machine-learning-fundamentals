# Classical Machine Learning Projects
Projects from the modules **AI and Machine Learning (CS 6002)** and **Introduction to Data Engineering and Machine Learning (CE4051)** taken in the MSc in AI and ML at UL

In these courses, the principles of ML and Data Science were studied theoretically and implemented practically in Pyhton.

## Machine Learning principles

Selection of projects implementing some classical machine learning problems.

### Gender prediction through NB Classification

* Training of a Classifier for prediction of the gender of a person using the **Naive-Bayes classification** algorithm.

### Flower species prediction through the perceptron algorithm
Demonstration of how the **perceptron algorithm** can be trained to learn the weights for input signals in order to draw linear decision boundary that allows us to **discriminate between the two linearly separable classes** +1 and -1. 

Below:
* An implementation of **Frank Rosenblatt's Perceptron**, the first algorithmically described neural network based on the idea of the **perceptron learning rule** which later served as the basis for modern multilayer neural networks and the whole field of Deep Learning.

* Application of **sklearn's implementation of the perceptron algorithm to predict flower classes using the Iris Dataset**
